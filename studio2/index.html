            <h2>Lily Stars Dress</h2>
            <p>My first self-patterned dress. Fabric pattern designed myself and printed onto cotton lawn at the textiles studio in Cruess Hall.Constructed after already having 2 all nighters for another project, this took another all nighter. It has my literally blood sweat and tears-- I stabbed myself a lot...</p>

            <h2>Love Buds Dress</h2>
            <p>I will be a Spring 2024 Graduate from UC Davis and this is the dress I will be wearing. Although graduation dresses are typically white- and I love white dresses, nothing looked good enough. This backless beauty is from Lacemade and is the first of my Lacemade collection. It was actually out of stock for a year and I was even told they weren't going to restock it, so one I saw they were back I bought it as soon as I saw it, which was in a car on our way to Mcdonalds.</p>

            <h2>White UNIQLO Japan-Exclusive Dress</h2>
            <p>So I learned a couple things. <br> 1. Uniqlos in Japan have different items than ones in the US. <br> 2. Japanese uniqlo only hold S,M,L sizes in-store, smaller/larger sizes are online only- I needed an XS. <br> 3. Dish soap can remove oil stains. <br>Buying this online was a struggle, I had to input a Japanese billing address... so I ended up just put my Japanese school's and it worked! Then I picked it up at the local Lawsons and it was in an unexpectedly large My Hero Academia box. I wore this out for the first time to the Gion Matsuri in Kyoto and ate the best wagyu skewers in my life only to find out I dripped oil all over and then proceeded to scrub it out with dishsoap at the Air BnB. </p>

            <h2>Pink Sailor School Set with Strawberry White Bows</h2>
            <p>Living my shojo anime dreams tbh. This whole outfit was a splurge especially the bows too but I couldn't be happier. The set is from Amavel and the bows are from Liz Lisa. This was the fit that @UCDfits came up to me for to ask for my picture so that was definietly unexpected, I never had anyone ask me for a photo cause of my outfit.</p>
