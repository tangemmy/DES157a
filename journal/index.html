                I never connected the fact that using a modal would save screen space as I always see it rather annoying since it's often poorly created. However, I was imediately reminded of how tutorials are often designed, with pop-ups providing directions and descriptions of various buttons and functions on a page, guiding users through tasks with overlaid instructions.
            </p> 
            <p>
                When implemented poorly, these pop-ups and overlays can be incredibly frustrating, especially when there isn't a clear way to exit them. It's reminiscent of the experience of dealing with a computer virus, where your screen is bombarded with countless pop-ups that refuse to close or disappear. If you've ever encountered such a situation, you'll understand the feeling of triggering a fight-or-flight response.

                There is definetly a time an place for them and when done well it can be an effective way to save space, giving more creative freedom for designers and add to the user experience rather than take away.

            <p>Forms are so mundane, and constructing a nice form  takes much more complexity than one may think. Salim Ansari’s Medium article, “Best Practices for Form Design,” gives 20 tips on how to improve the user experience of filling out online forms and sheds light on many issues I've been frustrated with before too. As Ansari calls out bad designs and how they make the user feel like giving up, it made me feel like my experiences were validated, and he gave solutions to those issues that I completely agree with. One of those is having the label at the top of the blank and not under. I can’t count the number of times I was confused about which empty box went with which label and then just filled it out hoping for the best. I also especially resonate with the note to be specific about what an error is instead of a vague “something went wrong”.</p>
                
            <p> As an upcoming graduate, I’ve been looking at job listings and came across a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/apply/213541">UX Intern position at Tesla</a>. I noted that their forms were simple and straightforward. The text boxes were well-spaced, and when you left a required field empty, they would highlight it in red with additional text to provide more information on what content needed to be added. Additionally, the optional sections were easily labeled with “(optional)” next to them.</p>
