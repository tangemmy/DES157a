        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>
                I am choosing to update my madlibs project because I like the theme I picked and the story is funny, but I feel like visual design is lacking.

    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>I want to mainly focus on design but functionality and usability will be a part of the design upgrade. I have already tested the current version with other friends and have noted a repeated pattern in the type of input they enter because of my wording choice. Another issue I want to address is having the story appear at the top instead of just appearing at the botto of the screen. Depending on the screen size, you may not see that the story has appeared and not know to scroll down.
    </p>
    <p>
    In terms of design changes, I feel that it is currently very plain. I want the background to feel more like you are filling out a form or like you are at an animal adoption center.I had another idea to customize the image of the cat based on the user input. </p>
